	/*Imagine we wanted to print all numbers from 1 to 5 in increasing or-
	der. We could do so as follows:*/

	/*But what would happen if we wanted to print from 1 to 20 instead? Or
	1 to 100? It would take plenty lines of code wouldn't it? Then, what if
	I told you there is a cleaner way to perform this?*/

	/*Such is the syntax of a for loop. It starts at 1, ends at 5 and adds
	one after each iteration. In each iteration, it prints out the current
	value of i. Notice that the stop condition is a <=. This is one of the
	six relative operators that we will see. Other three are: >=, < and >.
	Most, if not all of them, you should have already seen in any math
	class. In C, they "ask" questions. In this particular case, <= is as-
	king ig i is less than or eqaul to 5. We will see the other two opera-
	tors when we jump into if and else statements. Now, going back to loops
	if we wanted to print till 20, we would have to change the 5 to a 20:*/

	}
	/*I start at 1, until I reach 20 or less in jumps of 3 units. Neat as

	/*Your loop will DO whatever is inside the brackest WHILE the condition

	/*Which loop method to use? Well, whichever you like the best. All

	after one iteration has already happened. Let me show you:*/

	and decrement operators. Tweak 1, check. Next one, let me show you how
	to indent without \t. Let's re-print our triangular numbers, the first
	15 of them:*/

	by adding %X, where X represents how many indents you want:*/

	/*b's stopping condition was "hit" first, therefore, y didn't get all the
	 way to 4. The stopping condition that gets "hit" first, is the one that
	 determines when the loop stops. Additionally, some conditions can be 
	 missing, for example:*/

	 one inside the loop. We can also remove the stopping condition, but this
	 would make our loop run forever. BTW, to stop a running-forever loop in
	 the terminal, you type Ctrl+c. There is another way of stopping a loop in
	 a program, but we will look at it later. Just so you get the feeling, the
	 following loop will run forever, you will have to type Ctrl+c.*/
