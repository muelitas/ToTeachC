	 * but I highly recommend it you keep it). The setback of switch statements
	 * is that you can't check ranges. If we were to try and do the age's exam-
	 * ple here, we would have to create a single case for each year; painful
	 * right? The break statement is of ample importance here, if we forget it,
	 * we may get unexpected results: Try inputting A or B in the following

	 * case runs. And so on and so forth. This however, can be benefitial for
	 * us. For example, what if I wanted to accept lower case inputs in the
	 * previous example? We could do something like this:*/

	 * a or A, the output will be the same one.*/

	 * can be used to "break" the loop (exit out of it) if a condition is met.

	 * At the end, we display the total to the user. However, if the user in-
	 * puts an invalid number (negative number), we exit the loop and stop as-
	 * king for tips. Cool huh? But non-efficient if you ask me. Instead of
	 * terminating the loop and telling the user to start over, how do you
	 * think we could just ask for the value again? Answer: instead of doing
